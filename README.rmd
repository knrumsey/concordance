### Description 

`concordance` is an R package for performing concordance analyses and for the [discovery of active subspaces in high-dimensions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11241.pdf). The "workhorse" of the package is the `C_bass()` function, which estimates *Constantine's* $C$ matrix for a given computer model and behaves similarly to the `activegp::C_gp()` function (described in @wycoff2021sequential). The `C_bass()` function, which relies on a Bayesian MARS emulator (as described in @francom2020bass and implemented in the [BASS package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BASS)) is likely to be more efficient and accurate when the dimension of the input space is large and admits a large class of *measures* for the inputs. 

To install this package, use

```{R, eval=F}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("knrumsey/concordance@main")
```


This R package is based on the method described [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11241.pdf). A vignette for this package is also available and can be viewed by typing `browseVignettes("concordance")` in R (after installation).
