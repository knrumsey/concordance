`concordance` is an R package for performing concordance analyses and for the discovery of active subspaces (@constantine2015active) in high-dimensions. The "workhorse" of the package is the `C_bass()` function, which estimates *Constantine's* $C$ matrix for a given computer model and behaves similarly to the `activegp::C_gp()` function (described in @wycoff2021sequential). The `C_bass()` function, which relies on a Bayesian MARS emulator (as described in @francom2020bass and implemented in the [BASS package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BASS)) is likely to be more efficient and accurate when the dimension of the input space is large and admits a large class of *measures* for the inputs. 

To install this package, use

```{R, eval=F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("knrumsey/concordance")
```

A paper describing this method will be added once published. A vignette for this package is also available.
