Description: Tools for estimating the Constantine Matrix for a computer model `f` (or alternatively, the
  co-Constantine Matrix for two functions `f` and `g`, as in a "Concordance Analysis"). Works efficiently
  in high-dimensions by leveraging analytic results based on the Bayesian MARS emulator (with the `BASS` package).
